While often necessary, in some cases, polypharmacy is associated with various risks such as adverse drug interactions, increased side effects, medication non-adherence, and a decline in the patient's quality of life (Polypharmacy and Health-Related Quality of Life/Psychological Distress Among Patients With Chronic Disease, Van Wilder et al., 2022). Since polypharmacy is notoriously difficult to predict, it can make adhering to the Primum non nocere (first, do no harm) principle very difficult. As such, Polypharmacy is recognized as an increasingly serious problem affecting nearly 15% of the U.S. population (Trends in Prescription Drug Use among Adults in the United States, Kantor et al., 2015) and causing treatment costs of over $177 billion a year in the U.S. alone (Drug-related morbidity and mortality: updating the cost-of-illness model, Ernst, and Grizzle, 2001). According to \u201cA 12-gene pharmacogenetic panel to prevent adverse drug reactions: an open-label, multicentre, controlled, cluster- randomized crossover implementation study\u201d by Swen et al. 2023, pharmacogenetic-panel testing alone can reduce a patient\u2019s direct medical charges by more than USD 7000. We aim to mitigate this problem by leveraging state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to predict interactions between two or more drugs, anticipating side effects arising from polypharmacy.</p>"},{"location":"test/","title":"Test","text":"<p>page for testing</p> Method Description <code>GET</code>      Fetch resource <code>PUT</code>  Update resource <code>DELETE</code>      Delete resource <code>GET</code>      Fetch resource <code>PUT</code>  Update resource <code>DELETE</code>      Delete resource <code>GET</code>      Fetch resource <code>PUT</code>  Update resource <code>DELETE</code>      Delete resource <code>GET</code>      Fetch resource <code>PUT</code>  Update resource <code>DELETE</code>      Delete resource <code>GET</code>      Fetch resource <code>PUT</code>  Update resource <code>DELETE</code>      Delete resource <code>GET</code>      Fetch resource <code>PUT</code>  Update resource <code>DELETE</code>      Delete resource <code>GET</code>      Fetch resource <code>PUT</code>  Update resource <code>DELETE</code>      Delete resource <code>GET</code>      Fetch resource <code>PUT</code>  Update resource <code>DELETE</code>      Delete resource"}]}
