# Human Practices

We rigorously examined the implications of our research, focusing on ethical considerations, societal impact, regulatory frameworks,  ​​stakeholder engagement, and responsible scientific innovation.

## Living with Polypharmacy

“I had to throw myself in the car and drive home because of the pain. It is like a cramp in the stomach”, a real case of an 80-year-old woman, taking 10 medications simultaneously, living with and suffering from the adverse effects of polypharmacy.\
In addition to “allergic symptoms, diarrhoea, loss of hair, [...], nausea, dizziness, or fatigue”, patients experienced social isolation, and their “symptoms were not taken seriously by healthcare professionals” [^1].

​​As we witness our grandparents diligently sorting their pills, we are confronted with a profound question: how do these medications, each with its own distinct biochemical signature and mechanisms of action, interact within the human body?\
What impact do these medications have in conjunction with more complex biologics and therapeutics?

## The Solution is Software

Polypharmacy, is intrinsically tied to the vast reservoir of data and information that characterizes patients and human biology.\
In this context, knowledge-driven computational methods are not only justifiable but are essential tools for addressing the challenges posed by making predictions about polypharmacy.

## Communication Issues

Especially when developing software, consulting the end-user is vital.\
According to Dr. Muhammad Mamdani “AI is actually going to be useful when it is driven by people with problems”. “It has to come from endusers, from clinicians, who struggle with problems day-to-day”.\
With “this whole AI-thing, we see a lot of research, but the research is often quite meaningless”. “The vast majority of published papers would never ever deploy because it is clear that they didn’t speak to the clinician, or the methods used weren’t optimal”. “There has to be a mesh between the two” [^2].\
Hence, it became imperative for us to determine the actual user base for our tool and assess its demand.\
Additionally, we needed to identify the specifications and requirements necessary to meet this demand, and instead of imagining a problem that our users would have, solve actually existing problems.

## Bottom-up Development

As part of our investigation into entrepreneurship and commercial viability, we have determined two main user groups.
On the one hand, our model would be deployed in a healthcare setting, such as hospitals and care facilities, where it would be used by medical practitioners and professionals.\
On the other hand, academics, pharmaceutical scientists, and biologists would leverage our model to make predictions about how the compound or therapy they are developing fits into the complex system of the human body and infer how a cocktail of medications would interact with the human biochemistry and other compounds, minimizing risks and maximizing therapeutic benefits.\
Yet there are even more indirect stakeholders and interest groups that should not be overlooked.\
These include but are not limited to patients, local communities, non-government organizations, governments, environmental activists.
