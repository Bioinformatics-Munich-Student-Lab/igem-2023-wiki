## Overview
Adverse Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major cause of severe medical complications and a significant cause of inefficiencies in treatments worldwide. We are deeply convinced that SEPiA has the potential to minimize the risk of adverse DDIs for safe medication use by not only empowering patients and healthcare providers with AI-driven insights but also by bringing the power of AI prediction to the world pharmacovigilance community and providing accurate and impartial DDI knowledge to pharmaceutical companies during the drug design process - for the benefit of humanity. 

## Background
Studies estimate that around 17% of adult American citizens take five or more prescription drugs, meaning the United States alone accounts for more than 56 million polypharmacy patients. The elderly in particular are impacted by polypharmacy, as chronic ailments develop with age. Studies put the percentage of polypharmacy patients among this age demographic as ranging from 40 to 60%. These numbers are the result of an increase in drug prescriptions, especially for senior citizens,  over the last 20 years. In 2000, the prevalence of polypharmacy in the general population was 8%, constituting an average annual percent increase of 2.9%. Furthermore, this rate will grow significantly, as nations around the globe are undergoing a demographic shift towards generally older societies. This trend projects a strain on the healthcare-system that it is ill-equipped to handle in its current form. 

## Unique Selling Point
Our project uniquely builds on the proven scientific results from the CASTER project  (MIT/IBM) using … , and unlike any other model provides the ability to gauge the risk of interactions of all drugs of a medication plan concurrently as opposed to running 1:1 checks with existing methods. The combination of all relevant drugs together with the ability to combine it with patient data will contribute to a personalized medication plan and help in future drug design as we continue to enrich the dataset. Our solution includes two main parts -the AI model to predict polypharmaceutical side effects, and the SEPiA engagement app to capture relevant first hand data for personalized context and monitoring.  

## Market Analysis
SEPiA targets three different markets.

### Pharmacovigilance Market
The projected CAGR figures of the pharmacovigilance market ranging from 7.0% to 13.1% depending on the source highlight the growing importance.  Its market size is valued at 6.7 bn USD in 2022 (1) and is expected to grow to 14,85 bn in 2028 at the most conservative estimate.
 
### Drug Design Market
The drug design market, often referred to as the drug discovery market, is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. The most conservative estimates foresee a CAGR of 8,20 % with a market size value of 85.81 bn by 2030 ranging to a CAGR of 9,2 % from 2023 to 2032 and an expected size of 133,11 bn USD by 2032.
 
### Drug Interaction Checker Market 
There is no reliable market data available yet; however, the demand for medical consulting tools is expected to grow with telemedicine systems, online pharmacists, health technology companies, and research centers making drug interaction reviews available to patients through their websites and mobile apps (1). 


## Competitive Analysis

### Pharmacovigilance Market
DDI information is crucial in the Pharmacovigilance market as it allows identifying potential safety issues with drugs. It’s an integral part of ensuring drug safety and monitoring DDIs, driving the demand  (2). According to our market research, the pharmacovigilance community is mainly served by a limited number of companies such as  Certara Drug Interaction Solutions that rely on a manually curated collection of qualitative and quantitative human information. 

### Drug Design Market
DDI information helps pharmaceutical scientists in the design process of new drugs. Companies such as BioPharma Services and Certara offer a number of services from trial research to pre-clinical and clinical development. 

### Drug Interaction Checker Market 
 
There are multiple drug interaction checkers on the market. These include services by Drugs.com, Medscape, WebMD, and Drugbank. The following table presents a comparison between these services and SEPiA.
