Our iGEM journey was unique in its own right, as we embarked on a path less traveled by many teams in the competition. Unlike the classical experimental setups that are commonly associated with iGEM projects, our team took a different approach. We were a software-focused team, and our mission was to create a functioning neuronal network, a task that relied heavily on computational and engineering skills.

In our case, the absence of traditional experiments was not a limitation, but a strategic choice. Instead of conducting common experiments with test tubes and petri dishes, we undertook a series of iterations within the [engineering cycle](/munichbioinformatics/engineering/), where each iteration was an experiment in itself. Our goal was to engineer and optimize a system that could emulate the behavior of a neuronal network, which required a deep understanding of neuroscience and computational modeling.

These iterations were experiments in the truest sense, as we tested different algorithms, parameters, and methodologies to see if our approach would yield the desired results. The software we developed had to mimic the complexity and functionality of a real neuronal network, and each adjustment brought us closer to our ultimate goal.

Our iGEM experience was a testament to the diversity and innovation within the competition. While some teams focused on traditional biology experiments, we pushed the boundaries of what could be achieved through software and engineering. In the end, our journey taught us that experiments come in many forms, and sometimes the most unconventional paths lead to the most groundbreaking discoveries.
