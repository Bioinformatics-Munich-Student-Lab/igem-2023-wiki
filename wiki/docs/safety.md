iGEM Munich Bioinformatics takes great pride in our commitment to adhering to safety and security rules throughout our project.\
In line with the stringent requirements for Safety and Security in synthetic biology, we made significant efforts to ensure responsible practices and minimize potential risks associated with our work.

Firstly, we prioritized the use of anonymous data in our research, respecting privacy and ethical considerations. This approach allowed us to gather valuable information while safeguarding individuals' sensitive information.\
One of our notable achievements is the absence of data leaks, thanks to our responsible behavior.

Ensuring patient safety was a top priority for our team. We performed thorough testing and validation to check the accuracy and reliability of our AI models.\
This included running different scenarios, gathering data, and closely examining our models. Our goal was to reduce the chances of mistakes or incorrect prediction that could harm patients.

Recognizing the potential impact of our project emphasized the importance of extensive testing and validation.\
We understood that our AI models will be used in real-world healthcare settings, where they will influence important medical decisions.\ Any mistakes or weaknesses in our models could seriously affect patient well-being.

Because of this, our commitment to responsible AI development involved constantly monitoring and enhancing our models.\
This commitment not only met the high standards of Safety and Security in synthetic biology but also showed our ethical duty to protect human lives.

SEPiA has embraced the principles of safety and security in synthetic biology by adhering to strict guidelines and responsibly addressing the risks associated with our project.\
Our commitment to ethical practices and patient safety is at the core of our work, as we aim to make a positive impact on society while minimizing potential harm.
