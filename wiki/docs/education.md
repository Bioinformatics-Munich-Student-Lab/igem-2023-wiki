# Empowering the Future: SEPIA iGEM Team's Education Workshop on AI and Synthetic Biology

In fostering a deeper understanding of cutting-edge technology, the Bioinformatics Munich iGEM team recently conducted a captivating workshop for a high school class.\
This workshop aimed to enlighten students on the marvels of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications in synthetic biology while addressing ethical concerns, training them in creating their first Neural Network, and providing insights into the fascinating world of Deep Learning.

## Objectives

One of the primary objectives of our workshop was to impart a comprehensive understanding of AI to the students.\
We delved into the fundamentals of AI, explaining its role in modern society and its potential to revolutionize various fields.\
We also emphasized the importance of ethics in AI, engaging the students in thought-provoking discussions on the ethical considerations associated with AI-driven technologies.

## Mathematics made Digestable

To make the concept more relatable for the students, we began with a introduction to the theory and mathematics behind machine learning.\
These concepts can be very difficult to graps initially, and to increase accesibility we had to distill these concepts down to a point where no advanced mathematical knowledge was needed to grasp how neural networks function.

## MNIST

To make it easier for students to grasp the concepts behind AI, we began by briefly introduced MNIST.\
MNIST, Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, is a dataset of handwritten digits commonly used in machine learning and AI for tasks like digit recognition.\
We used MNIST to demonstrate how AI can be trained to recognize and classify handwritten numbers, making the problem more tangible for the students.\
Additionally, this allowed the students to gain insight into the everyday tools and techniques used by AI developers in their work.

## Discussing Inclusivity and Fariness in Data Utilization

Additionally, we highlighted the significance of considering the population from which data originates.\
For instance, we discussed how numbers are written slightly differently in the USA compared to Germany, emphasizing the importance of understanding these regional variations when working with data, especially in fields like medicine.\
We explained that data bias and cultural differences can have significant implications in healthcare and biomedical research.

## First hands on experience

The workshop encouraged students to roll up their sleeves and engage in practical learning.\
They were introduced to the basics of Deep Learning through the MNIST demo on a Google Colab Notebook and had the opportunity to create their first Neural Network.\
This hands-on experience not only demystified AI but also instilled confidence in the students, motivating them to explore AI further.\
Furthermore, we delivered this portion of the workshop in their native language, German, to make the entry into Neural Networks more accessible, as most resources are typically only available in English. This approach aimed to facilitate their understanding and engagement with Neural Networks from the very beginning.

## Applications in Synthetic Biology

Additionally, we taught how AI can be harnessed in synthetic biology.\
We shed light on AI's incredible possibilities in this field, from handling Polypharmacy to Protein Engineering.\
The students were inspired by the potential of AI to streamline research in synthetic biology, opening up new avenues for innovation.\
\
In addition to this, we took a step further by developing a curriculum to facilitate the introduction of AI into schools and its incorporation into the educational system, ensuring that our efforts have a broader impact on the educational community.\
This curriculum will enable other schools to teach AI effectively, making it an accessible point of entry into the world of AI and giving insights into the everyday life of a machine learning developer to a wider range of students.

## Fostering Dialogue

In line with the iGEM Education Award requirements, our approach was designed to create a two-way dialogue with the students.\
We utilized innovative educational tools and outreach activities to bridge the gap between synthetic biology, AI and the broader community.\
Through engaging discussions and interactive sessions, we encouraged the students to voice their opinions and concerns, fostering a deeper connection with the subject matter.

## Outcomes

The outcomes of our workshop were profoundly positive. The students left with a newfound appreciation for AI and its integration with synthetic biology.\
They gained valuable insights into ethical considerations, practical skills in AI, and an understanding of how AI can revolutionize synthetic biology.\
Most importantly, they developed a passion for scientific exploration and a desire to shape the future of synthetic biology.

## Reusable Curriculum

In conclusion, the SEPiA iGEM Team's workshop successfully empowered the high school with knowledge, skills, and a sense of responsibility. We have taken significant steps in shaping the future of synthetic biology by inclusively involving the community in the discourse of AI and its potential in this field.\
This workshop exemplifies our commitment to innovative education and outreach, laying the foundation for a brighter future in synthetic biology.
