A patient is described as undergoing polypharmacy if they are simultaneusoly taking more than 5 medications.
While often necessary for the treatment of multimorbid or vulnerable patients, polypharmacy is associated with various risks such as adverse drug interactions, increased incidence and severtiy of side effects, poor compliance, and decline in the patient's quality of life[^1].
Polypharmacy presents a distinct and frequently non-linear side effect profile that is in many cases still poorly understood.
Polypharmacy affects 15% of the general population in the U.S. and about 10-20% of in different European countries, with the incidence of polypharmacy rising sharply with age and poor health; in care settings, polypharmacy incidences above 50% are not uncommon[^2, 3].
Globally, polypharmacy affects hundreds of millions of people, a trend that is rising as the global population ages.

Because the number of possible combinations of different drugs increases exponentially with the amount of drugs a patient is taking, systematic laboratory testing of every possible combination of drugs for unwanted side effects is not practical.
To nevertheless address the problem of drug-drug interaction, our project aims to use advanced graph-based machine learning algorithms to predict drug interactions from the knowledge we have gained about which pathways of the human body each drug affects.
Using this approach, it is also possible to incorporate knowledge of individual genome or microbiome of the patient into the model, delivering care personalized to each patient.

Our vision is to use our mddel to provide doctors with the tools to do no harm by prescribing safe and healthy combinations of drugs, improving patient quality of life.
In order to make this vision a reality, we have established a close partnership with the Department of Clinical Pharmacology at the University Hospital Aachen in Germany.
This collaboration allows us to gather input from key medical stakeholders to deliver a practical, easy-to-use software that is able to empower the medical community from the get-go.
Through the network of RWTH Aachen, we would also be able to deploy our model in other German university hospitals, and ultimately internationally.
