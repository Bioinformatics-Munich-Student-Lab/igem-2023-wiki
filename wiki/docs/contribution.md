Polypharmacy is one of the pressing issues of today's healthcare systems. It is defined as the concurrent use of five drugs or more by a single patient. Across Europe, polypharmacy is highly prevalent, with a prevalence of 32.1% for persons of age 65+ [[1]].

Most of the problems with polypharmacy stem from the fact that side effects are often not being considered. Sepia is an attempt to provide a solution which is easy to use for patients, medical personnel as well as future researchers.

Sepia, which has the potential to streamline therapeutics development, is registered as a new basic part for the iGEM parts registry. Using it is straight-forward and well-documented.

To make sure that sepia is as easy to use as possible, we developed both a user-oriented interface and python packages for easy distribution. With its user interface, Sepia can be a significant benefit for patients and doctors looking for side effects with prescribed medication. For research and development with Sepia, we offer an easy-to-use python package on PyPI [[2]].Pretrained models and a docker container will also be made available through the Sepia GitHub repository [[3]].
