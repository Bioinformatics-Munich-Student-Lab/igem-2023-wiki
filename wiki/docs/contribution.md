Polypharmacy is one of the pressing issues of today's healthcare systems. It is defined as the concurrent use of five drugs or more by a single patient. Across Europe, polypharmacy is highly prevalent, with a prevalence of 32.1% for persons of age 65+ [[1]].

There are multiple risks associated with polypharmacy. Attention from medical personnel is required to prescribe medication in a polypharmacy scenario, nearly doubling healthcare costs and binding staff [[2]]. Drugs may be less effective or even lead to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) [[3]]. When the side effects associated with polypharmacy are not interpreted as ADRs, this may lead to "prescription cascades", where ADRs are treated by prescribing even more medication, further increasing the risks[[4]][[5]]. 

Most of the problems with polypharmacy stem from the fact that side effects are often not being considered. Sepia is an attempt to provide a solution which is easy to use both for patients and for medical personnel. By evaluating patients medication, problematic drug combinations could easily be substituted for combinations that improve side effects. 

With its user-oriented interface, Sepia can thus be a significant benefit for both patients and doctors. Going forward, the Sepia software could also be integrated into clinical or GP systems and automatically review the prescribed medication. When properly used, Sepia has the potential to improve patient outcome, save lives and reduce healthcare costs.
