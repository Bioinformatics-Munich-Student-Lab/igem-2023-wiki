### Introduction
Polypharmacy means taking a lot of different medications at the same time, which can happen when a person has several health conditions or sees multiple doctors. While these medications can help with specific problems, they can also lead to problems like interactions, side effects, or confusion. Polypharmacy is one of the pressing issues of today's healthcare systems. It is defined as the concurrent use of five drugs or more by a single patient. Across Europe, polypharmacy is highly prevalent, with a prevalence of 32.1% for persons of age 65+ [^1]. The SEPiA Team took action, developed a neuronal network that can predict these side effects to prevent polypharmacy, and developed the first polypharmacy model that can use multiple drugs as input. Sepia is an attempt to provide a solution which is easy to use for patients, medical personnel as well as future researchers. To make sure that Sepia is as easy to use as possible, we developed both a user-oriented interface and python packages for easy distribution. With its user interface, Sepia can be a significant benefit for patients and doctors looking for side effects with prescribed medication. For research and development with Sepia, we offer an easy-to-use python package on PyPI [^2].Pretrained models and a docker container will also be made available through the Sepia git repository [^3]. In the following, you can read about what kind of trouble we run into and what else you have to keep in mind if you want to do similar tasks.

### Data handling 
Our first task was to find enough data to be able to properly train our model which also doesnâ€™t take to many restrictions to work with these data. In the end we took data of the FDA which is already de-identified patient. One advantage of this decision was that we did have to pay for this data because it is for free available. When using these data you have to follow specific guidelines to pretect the patients.

#### Where to find healthcare data
| Method                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `Government Health Agencies`              | National Institutes of Health Data Sharing Repositories (e.g., PubMed, GenBank) contain valuable medical and biological data.                                                                                   |
| `Academic Research Institutions`          | Many universities and research institutions share medical datasets for research purposes. Stanford's MIMIC-III dataset for critical care research or the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for cancer-related research |
| `Open Data Initiatives`                   | Some organizations and initiatives focus on making medical data openly accessible. For instance, OpenMRS is an open-source medical record system that collects data from various healthcare settings            |
| `Data Science Competitions`               | Platforms like Kaggle host data science competitions that often include medical datasets                                                                                                                        |
| `Data Marketplaces`                       | marketplaces like IBM Watson Health's MarketScan, offer medical datasets for purchase or licensing                                                                                                              |
| `Collaboration with Healthcare Providers` | hospitals, clinics, or healthcare institutions are able to provide de-identified patient data. To do this, you have to keep privacy regulations like HIPAA in the United States in mind                         |

## How to use Sepia
1. Install the `sepia-polypharmacy` package from PyPI.
    ```shell
    pip install sepia-polypharmacy
    ```

2. Train the model using your own polypharmacy datasets
    
    ```shell
    sepia train --train <training_set.csv> --test <test_set.csv> --checkpoint <path_to_model>
    ```
   
    OR

    Download a checkpoint file from a pretrained model.
    Checkpoint files will be made available. A default checkpoint file is also included in the PyPI version.


3. Use the trained model to predict side effects for your chemical compound of interest. The `--checkpoint` parameter can be omitted - the default model will then be used.

   ```shell
   sepia predict --checkpoint <path_to_model> --drugs <drug1> <drug2>
   ```
