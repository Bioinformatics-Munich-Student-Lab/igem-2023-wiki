While often necessary for treating multimorbid or vulnerable patients, polypharmacy is associated with various risks such as adverse drug interactions, increased incidence, and severity of side effects, poor compliance, and decline in the patient's quality of life<sup>1</sup>. Polypharmacy presents a distinct and frequently non-linear side effect profile that is, in many cases, still poorly understood. Polypharmacy affects 15% of the general population in the U.S. and about 10-20% in different European countries, with the incidence of polypharmacy rising sharply with age and poor health; in care settings, polypharmacy incidences above 50% are not uncommon<sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>3</sup>. Globally, polypharmacy affects hundreds of millions of people, a trend that is rising as the global population ages.</p> <p>Because the number of possible combinations of different drugs increases exponentially with the number of drugs a patient is taking, systematic laboratory testing of every possible combination of drugs for unwanted side effects is not practical. To nevertheless address the problem of drug-drug interaction, our project aims to use advanced graph-based machine learning algorithms to predict drug interactions from the knowledge we have gained about which pathways of the human body each drug affects. Using this approach, it is also possible to incorporate knowledge of the individual genome or microbiome of the patient into the model, delivering care personalized to each patient.</p>"},{"location":"description/#approach","title":"Approach","text":"<p>Our vision is to use our model to provide doctors with the tools to do no harm by prescribing safe and healthy combinations of drugs, improving patient quality of life. In order to make this vision a reality, we have established a close partnership with the Department of Clinical Pharmacology at the University Hospital Aachen in Germany. This collaboration allows us to gather input from key medical stakeholders to deliver a practical, easy-to-use software that is able to empower the medical community from the get-go. Through the network of RWTH Aachen, we would also be able to deploy our model in other German university hospitals and, ultimately, internationally.</p>"},{"location":"description/#motivation","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>Our team was deeply motivated to choose this project because of the personal experiences many of us have had with elderly family members, particularly our grandparents.

While often necessary, in some cases, polypharmacy is associated with various risks such as adverse drug interactions, increased side effects, medication non-adherence, and a decline in the patient's quality of life (Polypharmacy and Health-Related Quality of Life/Psychological Distress Among Patients With Chronic Disease, Van Wilder et al., 2022). Since polypharmacy side effects are notoriously difficult to predict, it can make adhering to the Primum non nocere (first, do no harm) principle very difficult. As such, Polypharmacy is recognized as an increasingly serious problem affecting nearly 15% of the U.S. population (Trends in Prescription Drug Use among Adults in the United States, Kantor et al., 2015) and causing treatment costs of over $177 billion a year in the U.S. alone (Drug-related morbidity and mortality: updating the cost-of-illness model, Ernst, and Grizzle, 2001). According to \u201cA 12-gene pharmacogenetic panel to prevent adverse drug reactions: an open-label, multicentre, controlled, cluster- randomized crossover implementation study\u201d by Swen et al. 2023, pharmacogenetic-panel testing alone can reduce a patient\u2019s direct medical charges by more than USD 7000. The US are not the only country affected by this problem. In \u201cTrends in polypharmacy and dispensed drugs among adults in the Netherlands as compared to the United States\u201d Oktora et al. conducted a cross-sectional study in the netherlands, finding that polypharmacy prevalence increased from 3.1% to 8.0% over the time period from 1999 to 2014, as depicted in figure 1.</p> <p> </p> Figure 1"},{"location":"description_alt/#motivation","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>Our team was deeply motivated to choose this project because of the personal experiences many of us have had with elderly family members, particularly our grandparents.

The paper titled \u201cModeling Polypharmacy Side Effects with Graph Convolutional Networks\u201d, is the most notable work in the field. This approach takes into account the polypharmacy side effects and models them using a multimodal graph that includes protein-protein interaction networks and drug-drug interaction networks. However, the presented method has its limitations. It only uses network information and does not incorporate chemical structure information. It only makes predictions for known compounds. The model has been trained on datasets that are over six years old at this point. It is implemented in TensorFlow, which has been surpassed by Pytorch as the standard in industry and academia. New technologies, such as Encoder/Decoder and Large Language Models (LLMs) have since emerged which have uprooted the entire field. Due to the lack of a user interface, there is a high barrier to entry for medical professionals. As such, clinicians, researchers, and biologists have not had the chance to make polypharmacy side effect predictions. We aim to improve every aspect mentioned above and integrate the work that has previously been done with our own novel approach.</p>"},{"location":"description_alt/#our-project","title":"Our project","text":"<p>Using the \u201cDecagon\u201d-model as a basis, we intend to train our own neural network using more recent datasets that include a greater number of drug interactions.

We will also look into ways to improve the model\u2019s architecture taking recent developments in the field of deep learning into account. Furthermore, we have developed a relationship with a team at the University Hospital RWTH Aachen, allowing us to rely on patient data and practical feedback, therefore ensuring that we will be able to provide the best possible project for both patients and doctors.</p>"},{"location":"team/","title":"Team","text":""},{"location":"test/","title":"Test","text":""},{"location":"test/#test-page","title":"Test page","text":"<p>page for testing<sup>1</sup></p>"},{"location":"test/#test-structure","title":"Test  Structure","text":"<p>this is the structure test</p>"},{"location":"test/#abc","title":"ABC","text":"<p>ABC some content</p>"},{"location":"test/#def","title":"DEF","text":"<p>DEF some content</p>"},{"location":"test/#hover","title":"Hover","text":"<p>Hover me</p> <p></p> <p>do these changes propagate again?</p>"},{"location":"test/#code","title":"Code","text":"<pre><code>import pandas as pd\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch_geometric.datasets import Planetoid\nimport torch_geometric.nn as pyg_nn\n# Load the Cora dataset from PyTorch Geometric\ndataset = Planetoid(root='data/Cora', name='Cora')\n# Define a Graph Neural Network class\nclass GNNModel(nn.Module):\ndef __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, num_classes):\nsuper(GNNModel, self).__init__()\nself.conv1 = pyg_nn.GCNConv(input_dim, hidden_dim)\nself.conv2 = pyg_nn.GCNConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)\nself.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, num_classes)\ndef forward(self, data):\nx, edge_index = data.x, data.edge_index\nx = self.conv1(x, edge_index)\nx = F.relu(x)\nx = self.conv2(x, edge_index)\nx = F.relu(x)\nx = pyg_nn.global_mean_pool(x, data.batch)\nx = self.fc(x)\nreturn F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)\n# Instantiate the model\ninput_dim = dataset.num_node_features\nhidden_dim = 64\nnum_classes = dataset.num_classes\nmodel = GNNModel(input_dim, hidden_dim, num_classes)\n# Define loss function and optimizer\ncriterion = nn.NLLLoss()\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n# Training loop\ndef train():\nmodel.train()\noptimizer.zero_grad()\noutput = model(dataset[0])  # Pass the first graph in the dataset\nloss = criterion(output, dataset[0].y)\nloss.backward()\noptimizer.step()\n# Training for a few epochs\nfor epoch in range(100):\ntrain()\nprint(f'Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')\nprint('Hello World')\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"test/#figures","title":"Figures","text":"<p>Trends in Polypharmacy</p> <p> <p>Trends in polypharmacy among adults in the Netherlands 1999\u20132014, stratified by age.<sup>3</sup> </p>"},{"location":"test/#keys","title":"Keys","text":"<p>Cmd+Option+Del \u2260 \u00a9Alt+F4\u2122</p>"},{"location":"test/#citations","title":"Citations","text":"<p>this is a test<sup>2</sup> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
